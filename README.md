# dax-kiro-proxy specification repository

This repository is the implementation boundary for a new, standalone Kiro ACP proxy.
Implementation is proceeding in Go from these specifications. It contains no source code copied from,
derived line-by-line from, or linked to another repository.

The intended product presents an Anthropic Messages-compatible loopback gateway to a client such as
Claude Code and uses the locally installed Kiro CLI through Agent Client Protocol (ACP) as its model
backend. The client remains responsible for executing tools and enforcing its own permission and hook
policies.

## Document order

Read these documents before implementation:

1. `CLEAN_ROOM_BOUNDARY.md` — provenance, licensing boundary, and prohibited inputs.
2. `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` — goals, scope, external behavior, and security posture.
3. `PROTOCOL_SPEC.md` — HTTP, SSE, ACP, and relay wire contracts.
4. `FLOWS_AND_STATE.md` — request flows, state machines, recovery, and concurrency.
5. `IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIREMENTS.md` — component boundaries and staged delivery plan.
6. `ACCEPTANCE_SPEC.md` — black-box requirements and release gates.
7. `LANGUAGE_DECISION.md` — criteria for selecting Go or Rust before implementation.
8. `PHASE_0_REVIEW.md` — specification findings, proposed resolutions, and remaining gates.
9. `LANGUAGE_DECISION_RECORD.md` — confirmed Go selection and the historical Go/Rust experiment design.
10. `DEPENDENCY_REVIEW.md` — candidate licenses, provenance checklist, and outstanding review work.
11. `IMPLEMENTATION_DECISIONS.md` — adopted wire, lifecycle, and resource policies.
12. `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` — implementation evidence and remaining acceptance gates.

`AGENTS.md` makes this reading order mandatory for coding agents.

## Current phase

The user selected Go and authorized implementation through the complete standalone product. The
specification-only baseline is `7b108dd`. Phase 0 reports retain the historical unmeasured experiment
design; the explicit language selection supersedes comparative experiments as a selection gate.
Rights/license and live-release gates remain open. Implementation begins with independent fixtures
and fake-process transport tests. Consult DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md for verified progress.

## Naming

`dax-kiro-proxy` is the working product and executable name. Names, environment variables, endpoint
prefixes, and temporary artifacts belonging to an earlier host project are not part of this contract.
